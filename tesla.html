				<p>esla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[b]) is an American electric vehicle and clean energy
					company
					based in Austin, Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage from
					home to
					grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is one of
					the world's
					most valuable companies and remains the world's most valuable automaker with a market capitalization
					of more
					than US $1 trillion. The company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles and
					plug-in electric
					vehicles, capturing 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market and 16% of the plug-in
					market (which
					includes plug-in hybrids) in 2020. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is
					a major
					installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest
					global suppliers
					of battery energy storage systems, with 3.99 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2021.
					Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a
					tribute to
					inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment,
					X.com co-founder
					Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company and its chairman. He has served as CEO since
					2008.
					According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and
					energy,
					obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model,
					the Roadster
					sports car, in 2009. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the
					Model 3 sedan
					in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in
					electric car
					worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8]
					Tesla's global
					sales were 936,222 cars in 2021, a 87% increase over the previous year,[9] and cumulative sales
					totaled 2.3
					million cars at the end of 2021.[10] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached $1
					trillion, the
					sixth company to do so in U.S. history.
					Tesla has been the subject of several lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and acts of
					CEO Elon
					Musk and from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation, worker rights
					violations, and
					unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the National
					Highway Traffic
					Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles
					equipped with
					Autopilot.

		<h2 id="founding">founding</h2>
		<p>The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc
			Tarpenning.[11] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.[12] Eberhard said he wanted to
			build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery,
			the computer software, and the proprietary motor".[13]

			Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[11] In February 2004, the company raised
			$7.5 million in series A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from
			the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and
			the largest shareholder of Tesla.[11][14][12] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as Chief Technical
			Officer.[11]

			A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard,
			Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[15]</p>

		<h2 id="roadster">Roadster</h2>
		<p>Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was
			not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[16] From the beginning, Musk consistently maintained
			that Tesla's long-term goal was to create affordable mass market electric vehicles.[17] The company's
			strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream
			vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18]

			In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor
			Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw
			investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former
			eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private
			financing investment to over $105 million.[20]

			Prototypes of Tesla's first car, the Roadster, were officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in
			Santa Monica, California, at a 350-person invitation-only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica
			Airport.[21]

			In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[22] Eberhard then
			took the title of "President of Technology" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008.
			Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also
			left the company in January 2008.[23] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in
			December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[24] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[24] In
			June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[25]

			Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008.[26]

			By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of
			his own money to the company.[27]

			In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States
			Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan
			Program, supported engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial
			powertrain technology.[28] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million interest.[29][30]</p>

					<h2 id="ipo">IPO</h2>
					<p>In May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California,
						from Toyota for
						$42 million,[31] and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S.[32]
						On June 29,
						2010, the company became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ, the
						first American
						car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued
						13.3 million
						shares of common stock at a price of $17.00 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In January
						2012, Tesla
						ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S
						luxury
						sedan.[35] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013
						Motor Trend
						Car of the Year,[36] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a
						country, when
						it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[37] The Model S
						was also the
						best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[38] Tesla announced the
						Tesla
						Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started
						shipping with
						sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called "hardware version
						1" .[39] In
						April 2015, Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and
						Tesla
						Powerpack (business) battery packs.[40] The company received orders valued at $800 million
						within a week of
						the unveiling.[41] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in
						September 2015,
						at which time it had 25,000 pre-orders.[42][43]>

					<p>The Tesla Model X is a mid-size crossover SUV. It is offered in 5-, 6- and 7-passenger
						configurations. The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Model S. The
						rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating "falcon-wing" design.

						Deliveries started in September 2015.[103] In 2016, after one full year on the market, the Model
						X ranked seventh among the world's best-selling plug-in cars.[38] The United States is its main
						market, with an estimated 57,327 units sold through September 2018.[104]</p>

					<h2 id="y">model y</h2>
					<p>The Model Y is a compact crossover utility vehicle. The Model Y is built on a platform that
						shares many components with the Model 3.[119] The car has up to three rows of seats (up to 7
						people),[120] 68 cubic feet (1.9 m3) of cargo space (with the second and third rows
						folded),[121] and has an EPA range of up to 326 miles (525 km).[122]

						The Model Y was unveiled on March 14, 2019.[123] Deliveries for the Model Y started on March 13,
						2020. The Tesla Model Y is being manufactured at Tesla Factory in Fremont, California,[124] as
						well as in Giga Shanghai in China. A version of the Model Y is also expected to be produced at
						Giga Berlin once the factory is open.[125]</p>

				<p>The Model 3 is a four-door fastback sedan. Tesla unveiled the Model 3 on March 31, 2016.[105]
					Potential customers began reserving spots earlier that day with a refundable deposit.[106] One
					week after the unveiling, Tesla reported over 325,000 reservations.[107] Bloomberg News claimed
					that, due to the number of reservations, "the Model 3's unveiling was unique in the 100-year
					history of the mass-market automobile."[108] Limited vehicle production began in July 2017.[109]

					Since March 2020, the Model 3 is the world's best selling electric car in history, and
					cumulative global sales passed the 1 million milestone in June 2021.[8][110][111] The Model 3
					has ranked as the world's best selling plug-in electric car for four consecutive years, from
					2018 to 2021,[111][112][113] and also as the best selling plug-in electric car in the United
					States since 2018.[114][115][116] The Model 3 also set records in Norway and the Netherlands, as
					the best selling passenger car model in those countries in 2019.[117][118]</p>
